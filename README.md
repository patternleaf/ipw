# Intro to Programming for the Web

This is the online "course reader" for a 10-session introductory programming course, focusing on PHP.

## What's In Here?

An in-development small homemade PHP webapp framework, and content for the course, which is also in progress. The app uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for its grid and widgets.

## Current Status

Still (always?) in development!
