						<ul>
							<li>Error conditions are handledâ€”try putting in an invalid email address.</li>
							<li>If your submission fails, the form is pre-filled when it reloads.</li>
							<li>URLs are nice and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESTful">RESTful</a>.</li>
							<li>The code structured in a decoupled, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> way.</li>
						</ul>
						
						You can take a look at the PHP code for the app below. This does not show the HTML (presentation) side of things, but is code for a general "guestbook" app that could be presented in many ways. Hopefully by the end of the course you'll be able to write something like this yourself!

					<h1>Homework</h1>
					<p>
						For these exercises, use your HTTP server environment. The URL of the pages when you load them in your browser should start with <code>http://</code>, not <code>file://</code>.
					</p>
					<h3>1. Moby Dick</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Download <a href="moby-dick-edited.txt">this plain text file</a>, make it accessible from your server, and turn it into an HTML5 document. You might look at <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/">an HTML template</a> as a starting point.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mark it up as you see fit based on the semantics of HTML5 tags. Refer to the <a href="http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html">Periodic Table of the Elements</a> of whatever source you prefer. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Make sure your markup <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validates</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Find an image and embed it into the document. (Try <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=whale&l=cc&ss=2&ct=6&mt=all&w=all&adv=1">searching on flickr's CC-licensed images</a>, maybe?)
						</li>
						<li>
							Use a CSS reset to void your browser's default styling. Find one you like or <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/">try this one</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Recover some minimal amount of styling&mdash;headers, paragraphs, and so on.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make sure everything still <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validates</a>.
						</li>
					
					</ol>
				
					<p>
						The text file comes from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>. Note that it does <strong>not</strong> contain the complete text of Moby Dick. :)
					</p>
					
					<h3>2. Hello, PHP</h3>
					
					<p>
						Follow the instructions <a href="/decks/intro-to-php">here</a>. More on this later.
					</p>
					
					<h3>3. (Optional for CSS Pratice) Pizza Recipe</h3>
				
					<p>
						Download <a href="pizza-test.zip">pizza-test.zip</a>. Expand the archive. Inside you'll find some jpeg images, an HTML file, and a folder called "notes". The HTML file contains a recipe which is marked up with reasonably semantic HTML, but no CSS styling. The "notes" folder contains some images ("comps") show a desired look for the page.
					</p>

					<p>
						Your job is to add CSS to this page such that it looks like the comps. <strong>You should not need to change the markup</strong> to achieve the desired look. 
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>There are some pixel measurements specified in the comps which should be used.</li>
						<li>Note that some elements have ids and there are a couple of classes. Those can be used to good effect via CSS selectors.</li>
						<li>
							There are probably a few different ways to achieve the look. The solution I picked involves the following CSS properties: <code>width, margin, border, border-bottom, padding, clear, background-color, float, display</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't worry if the 7 in step 7 is rendered over the image. The comps were screenshots from Firefox which renders differently than WebKit (Safari and Chrome).
						</li>
						<li>
							There's a place in the header with a note "YOUR CSS GOES IN HERE". Your CSS goes in there. :)
						</li>
					</ol>
				
					<p>Don't forget to <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validate</a> the result!</p>
